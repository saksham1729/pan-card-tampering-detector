# 🧾 PAN Card Tampering Detection System using Machine Learning

This project is a **PAN Card Tampering Detection System** developed using **Python** and **Machine Learning** techniques. It can detect whether a given image of a PAN card has been tampered with or not. This helps in preventing document forgery and identity fraud by validating the authenticity of digital PAN card copies.
